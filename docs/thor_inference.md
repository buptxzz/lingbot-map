# Thor Inference Optimizations

Four opt-in optimization groups improve the historical 1000-frame whole-frame
CUDA Graph benchmark from **5.145 to 6.844 FPS (+33.0%)** on NVIDIA Thor.
The input is **518 x 378 (width x height), 1005 tokens/frame**, batch size one.

The optimization modules and benchmark are separate from the default model,
training code and demo. No option is enabled by importing the package.

## Optimization Groups

1. **MLP/QKV weight caching.** Reuse non-persistent BF16 weights and biases
   instead of converting the same FP32 parameters on every frame. The original
   parameters and checkpoint keys are preserved.
2. **Projection caching and combined KV append.** Cache attention output
   projection weights and use one FlashInfer paged-KV append per global block
   for patch and special tokens. The KV-write subgraph goes from 96 to 24 nodes.
   Projection caching and append have separate switches.
3. **FA4 dual-stage Query staging.** Adopt upstream FA4 beta15's SM110 Query
   loading schedule. Upstream source, license and attribution are packaged
   separately from the local integration.
4. **Single-page KV addressing.** Use affine addressing for KV tiles contained
   in one page. Cross-page tiles and tails retain the general loader.

## Performance

| Cumulative configuration | FPS | Gain over previous row |
|---|---:|---:|
| All options off | 5.145 | - |
| + MLP/QKV weight caching | 5.762 | +12.0% |
| + Projection caching and combined KV append | 5.828 | +1.2% |
| + FA4 dual-stage Query staging | 6.687 | +14.7% |
| + Single-page KV addressing | **6.844** | **+2.3%** |

The combined throughput gain is **33.0%**. Rows are cumulative; the incremental
percentages are not additive. See the [measurement record](thor_legacy_1005_ablation.md)
for repetitions, timing boundaries and machine-readable results.

The checked-in harness independently revalidated the endpoint pair at 5.146 and
6.845 FPS using the same protocol; both values are within 0.03% of the
historical 5.145 and 6.844 FPS record.

### Benchmark Contract

Both arms use the same historical BF16 path, random weights, four camera
refinement iterations, and enabled camera/depth heads. There are eight scale
frames, ten streaming warmup frames and 982 whole-frame graph replays.
Input update, cache preparation and synchronization are included; construction,
compilation, rehearsal, capture and output collection are excluded.

The isolated harness preserves capture-fixed Python camera/temporal state,
the historical special-page handoff and FP32 position arithmetic in both arms.
These are synthetic ablation results, not default-demo throughput or a
real-sequence reconstruction-quality evaluation. "Lossless" compares the
optimization switches against this same all-off BF16 benchmark baseline.

## Environment

The recorded runs used NVIDIA Thor (SM110), 120 W power mode, Python 3.12.13,
PyTorch 2.12.0+cu130, CUDA 13.0, FlashInfer 0.6.11.post3 and CuTe DSL 4.5.2.
Install the matching PyTorch/CUDA build first, then install from the checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[thor]'
```

FA4 beta14 is the installed reference. The Query-staging option selects the
packaged beta15 implementation before its first import. Use a fresh process
when changing FA4 or optimization options.

## Independent Switches

| Switch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--cache-mlp-weights` | Global, frame and patch MLP weight caches |
| `--cache-qkv-weights` | Global, frame and patch QKV weight caches |
| `--cache-projection-weights` | Attention output projection caches |
| `--merge-kv-append` | Combined patch and special-token append |
| `--fa4-query-staging` | Packaged FA4 beta15 Query schedule |
| `--paged-kv-affine` | Single-page addressing; requires Query staging |

All six switches default to off. The optional `--visible-window 56` additionally
requires `--allow-approximate`; it is not part of the lossless result above.
It changes attention visibility, not the physical 64-page patch allocation.

## Reproduction

Run from the repository root. The harness is a checkout-only benchmark under
`tools/thor_legacy_1005`; no installed inference command or checkpoint is needed.
Its input dimensions, seed, head configuration and capture protocol are fixed.

### Short Reproduction

This command runs a discarded preflight, all-off reference, four cumulative
optimized configurations and an all-off repeat in separate processes. The
default regression length is 200 frames, including 182 graph replays.

```bash
python -m tools.thor_legacy_1005.sweep validate \
  --out-dir /tmp/thor-ablation
```

It compares pose/depth for every collected scale, warm and replay output,
checks finiteness, verifies unchanged FP32 parameters and checkpoint keys,
and rejects incomplete, stale, or unstable reference records. Every validation
record carries the runner contract identifier and expected frame count, so a
benchmark cannot consume results from a different runner or workload.
Validation is specific to the isolated whole-frame protocol. It is not an
uncaptured streaming check.

### 1000-Frame Timing

After successful validation, run the same configurations in forward and reverse
order. The command rechecks the validation records before starting any timing.

```bash
python -m tools.thor_legacy_1005.sweep benchmark \
  --out-dir /tmp/thor-ablation
```

Each child process explicitly sets its switches, clears inherited experimental
flags and enables the FA4 compile cache. Logs, commands, raw timings and output
comparisons are retained in the output directory. Existing runs are never
overwritten. Use a new directory for another campaign.

For just the all-off/full-stack pair, pass `--scope endpoints` to both commands.
For a single diagnostic run:

```bash
python -m tools.thor_legacy_1005.run --frames 19 \
  --cache-mlp-weights --cache-qkv-weights \
  --cache-projection-weights --merge-kv-append \
  --fa4-query-staging --paged-kv-affine \
  --out /tmp/thor-full-smoke.json
```

### Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_thor*.py' -v
```

The tests cover option isolation, unsupported shapes, append/cache behavior,
whole-frame capture control flow and rejection of invalid timing/comparison
records. GPU tests require the Thor environment. The separate FA4 checker also
compares captured kernel outputs with its reference across supported shapes.

## Rollback

Use a fresh process with all six switches off. To avoid the benchmark path
entirely, use the unchanged upstream model or demo. Do not reuse a patched
model for training, checkpoint replacement, device changes or another sequence.
